# GRAPHYTTI
This project is aimed at implementing an GUI interface for easily visualising
the results of the fluorescence intensity decay experiment.
Our client is Prof. Swaminathan of the Biosciences and Bioengineering department
in IIT Guwahati.

Our client's requirements are

* A quick way to observe graphs from the result data

* Avoid the need of printing the graph if unsuccessful

We aim to achieve this with an application built with the Qt framework licensed under the LGPL and also publication
quality graph plots with the QCustomPlot library under the GPL.

After meeting the above requirements quickly, we aim to go into the analysis aspect and eliminate his ordeal of going 
to the command line there as well.
